#001first you need to create a list based on a selection of the geometries you want to apply a specific attribute#
cosas = cmds.ls(selection=True)

#002with this command you can check the geometries are assigned to that list
print cosas


# This command is just to put the list in different order.
for culero in cosas:
    print culero

#003 apply this command to run the script, and thats it#

for algo in cosas:
    cmds.setAttr(algo + ".aiOpaque", 0)


#this command is for individual changes based on the print list
#example
    
cmds.setAttr("pCube1.aiOpaque", 1)
